# Mini games Julia
This is a mini project written in Julia programming language. </br>
The project is guided from this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-julia-by-coding-7-projects). </br>
To run the files, you need to install [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/downloads/) </br>
There are three games: 1. Number guessing game, 2. Rock Paper Scissors, 3. Countdown. You can run the file game.jl to play three games on terminal by using the command ```julia game.jl```, or you can run the other files to play each game respectively.
